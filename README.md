# In order to find the highest performing model, we must find the optimal values for hyper-parameters. 
We evaluated the accuracy and AUC against the n estimators of Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB to find the best method.
Afterwards, we compare the performance of all of them against each other.
